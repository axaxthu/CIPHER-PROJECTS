This project is a simple number guessing game called "Guess It, Win It."

Objective: The objective of the game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.
User Interface: The game provides a text-based user interface where messages and prompts are displayed in the console.

Features:

1.Random Number Generation:
  At the start of the game, a random number (ranNum) between 0 and 99 is generated using rand() % 100.
2.Gameplay Mechanics:
  Guessing Mechanism: The player guesses the number, and the game provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
  Attempts Limit: The player has a fixed number of attempts (trials = 3) to guess the correct number.
3.Score System:The player starts with a score of 100, which decreases by 10 points after each unsuccessful attempt.
  Additional deductions occur if the player uses hints.
4.Hints System:
   1. Availability: Two hints are available:
   2. Odd/Even Hint: Reveals whether the number is odd or even.
   3. Prime/Composite Hint: Reveals whether the number is prime or composite.
   Usage: Hints can only be used once per game. Each hint usage deducts 10 points from the score.
5.End of Game:
   Win Condition: The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number within the allowed attempts (trials).
   Loss Condition: If the player exhausts all attempts without guessing the number correctly, they lose the game.
6.User Feedback:
   After each guess, the game provides feedback on the proximity of the guess to the actual number ("too high," "too low," etc.).
   Upon winning or losing, appropriate messages are displayed along with the correct number and final score.

Functionality:
Prime Number Check: Uses a function (isprime()) to check if a number is prime, which influences the hint system.
Dynamic Interaction: The game dynamically interacts with the player through console inputs (cin) and outputs (cout).
Score Tracking: Tracks and displays the player's score throughout the game, reflecting deductions for hint usage and unsuccessful attempts.
