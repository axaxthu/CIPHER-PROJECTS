This C++ project is designed to manage users and their friendships through a menu-driven interface.
It utilizes maps and sets to store user information and track friendships between users.

Features and Functionalities:
1.User Class (User):
  Attributes: Each user has a first name, last name, age, and gender.
  Initialization: Users are initialized using their first name as a unique identifier (username).
2.Data Structures:
  map<string, User> mapUserName: Maps usernames (first names) to User objects.
  map<string, set<string>> Friends: Maps each user (by username) to a set of usernames representing their friends.
3.Functions:
  void addUser(string userName, User user): Adds a new user to mapUserName if the username doesn't already exist.
  void makeThemFriend(string userName1, string userName2): Establishes a friendship between two users by adding each other to their respective friend sets in Friends.
  void removeFriendship(string userName1, string userName2): Removes the friendship between two users by deleting each other from their friend sets in Friends.
  void displayAllUser(): Displays all users and their details stored in mapUserName.
  void displayAllFriendships(): Displays all friendships stored in Friends, showing which users are friends with whom.
  void displayMenu(): Displays a menu with options for adding friends, removing friends, viewing friends, viewing all users, and exiting the program.
4.Menu-Driven Interface (main() function):
  User Input Handling: Prompts the user to enter details for three users initially, including first name, last name, age, and gender.
  Menu Options:
  Add Friend: Allows users to specify two usernames to establish a friendship.
  Remove Friend: Enables users to specify two usernames to terminate their friendship.
  View Friends: Displays all current friendships stored in Friends.
  View All Users: Shows a list of all users and their details stored in mapUserName.
  Exit: Ends the program execution.
5.Error Handling:
  Invalid Input: Provides messages for invalid menu choices and ensures usernames entered for adding or removing friendships exist in mapUserName.
